> When I first learned about mathematical induction it seemed like complete magic. You proved a formula like 􏰆ni=1 i = n(n + 1)/2 for some basis case like 1 or 2, then assumed it was true all the way to n − 1 before proving it was true for general n using the assumption. That was a proof? Ridiculous!

>When I first learned the programming technique of recursion it also seemed like complete magic. The program tested whether the input argument was some basis case like 1 or 2. If not, you solved the bigger case by breaking it into pieces and calling the subprogram itself to solve these pieces. That was a program? Ridiculous!
